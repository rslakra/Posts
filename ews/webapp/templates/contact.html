<h2>Leverage Blueprints</h2>
<p>
  As your Flask project grows, you have lots of view functions and other related bits of code that work together.
  Instead of adding all these directly to a basic app.py file, you can create blueprints that you register in your
  application factory.
</p>
<p>
  Blueprints are modules that contain related views that you can conveniently import in __init__.py. For example, youâ€™ll
  have a blueprint that stores the main pages of your project.
