Beginning with an attention-grabbing headline, a well-formatted blog post should also feature relatively brief sentences that convey ideas quickly. The post should also include subheads or section heads, helping readers to quickly understand the message or skip to sections that are more interesting to them. Additionally, photos and other graphics can increase readership, interest, and SEO rankings across search engines.",
